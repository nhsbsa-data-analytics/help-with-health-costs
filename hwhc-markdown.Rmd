## 3 About these statistics

### 3.1 Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) {.toc-ignore}

Statistical disclosure control has been applied to these statistics. Volume figures have been redacted in the supporting summary tables if they relate to fewer than 5 items. Further information about our statistical disclosure control protocol [can be found on our website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/policies-and-procedures).

### 3.2. Rounding {.toc-ignore}

The high-level figures in this statistical summary have been rounded where appropriate for clarity. In most cases rounding has been to two significant figures in the key findings and information boxes and three significant figures in the main text. This is to make this narrative as accessible as possible to all readers. The summary tables released with this publication allow users to investigate this data at lower levels of granularity. Figures in the supplementary tables have not been rounded.

### 3.3. Index of deprivation {.toc-ignore}

The [English Indices of Deprivation 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) have been used to provide a measure of patient deprivation. The English Indices of Deprivation are an official national measure of deprivation that follows an established methodological framework to capture a wide range of individuals' living conditions.

The reported IMD quintile, where 1 is the most deprived and 5 the least deprived, is derived from the postcode currently held for an applicant. There are a small number of records each year that we have reported as having an unknown IMD quintile. These are applicants with no fixed abode or with british forces addresses, or where we have been unable to match the applicant postcode to a postcode in the [National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) - May 2022](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/national-statistics-postcode-lookup-may-2022/about).

IMD quintiles are calculated by ranking census lower-layer super output areas (LSOAs) from most deprived to least deprived and dividing them into equal groups. These range from the most deprived 20% (quintile 1) of small areas nationally to the least deprived 20% (quintile 5) of small areas nationally.

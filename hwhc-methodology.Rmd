Published `r config$publication_date`
  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
## 1. Background information
  
The NHSBSA administer a range of services to help people with the health costs, include help with:

* NHS prescription costs
* NHS dental costs
* sight tests, glasses and contact lenses
* travel to receive NHS treatment
* NHS wigs and fabric supports

Full details of these schemes are available on the [NHS Help with Health Costs webpage](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-help-health-costs).

Six different certificate schemes are available, with different levels of help with health costs:

* [NHS Prescription Prepayment certificate     (PPC)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/nhs-prescription-prepayment-certificate-ppc)
* [NHS Tax credit exemption certificate](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/exemption-certificates/nhs-tax-credit-exemption-certificates)
* [Medical exemption certificate](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-if-you-have-nhs-exemption/medical-exemption-certificates)
* [Maternity exemption certificate](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-if-you-have-nhs-exemption/maternity-exemption-certificates)
* [NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-low-income-scheme)
* [NHS Hormone Replacement Therapy Prescription Prepayment Certificate (HRT     PPC)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/nhs-hormone-replacement-therapy-prescription-prepayment-certificate-hrt-ppc)

These statistics provide estimates of volumes related to these certificate schemes. Data covers the financial years 2019/2020 to 2023/24, where the financial year runs from April 1 to March 31.

#### Users and uses

This publication can have a wide range of uses, including:

* informing government or local NHS policy
* allowing public scrutiny of national and regional prescribing habits
* responding to queries made under the Freedom of Information (FOI) act
* supporting resolution of ad-hoc enquiries

The NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) administer services providing help with health costs. The data that forms the basis of these statistics is collected as a by-product of this process.


## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Applicant/certificate holder details {.toc-ignore}

#### 2.1.1 Age

Reported ages represent the age of the applicant when they submitted the application.

Some certificates may also provide support for partners and dependent children. In these cases, the age will represent the age of the lead applicant only.

It may not be possible to calculate an age if the applicant's date of birth was not supplied or was incorrect. If the captured date of birth looks incorrect, the age will classified as "unknown". Age restrictions will differ between services, as defined in the relevant "methodology" sections.

#### 2.1.2  Location (Country/ICB)
These statistics use the National Statistics Postcode lookup (NSPL) to identify ICB and country for each individual. This uses the captured postcode information supplied for the application/certificate.

Postcodes are usually provided during application process. Some applicant's may then update postcode details when addresses change. The postcode used for these statistics will represent the latest known postcode information.

Due to the method used to assign location, some data may change between releases. Historic location data may change:

* if a person moves postcode and updates their details between releases
* if the NSPL reclassifies a postcode against a different area in the new NSPL edition

#### 2.1.3  Deprivation
Deprivation reporting uses the [English Indices of Deprivation 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019). In particular, the headline Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). IMD data combines with the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) using lower-layer super output area (LSOA) 2011. This identifies the general deprivation for an applicant's postcode. 

The measure of deprivation reported in these statistics is the IMD quintile. Each quintile represents 20% of the population, based on groups of LSOA. If an applicant's postcode does not map to the NSPL the data will be reported as 'unknown' IMD quintile.

Postcodes are usually provided during application process. Some applicant's may then update postcode details when addresses change. The postcode used for these statistics will represent the latest known postcode information.

Due to the method used to assign IMD quintile, some data may change between releases. Historic location data may change: 

* if a person moves postcode and updates their details between releases to a LSOA in a different IMD quintile
* if the NSPL reclassifies a postcode against a different quintile in the new NSPL edition

### 2.2 Service specific data capture methodology {.toc-ignore}

#### 2.2.1 NHS Low Income Scheme
Reporting reflects data available in the NHSBSA Data Warehouse environment as of `r format(as.Date(config$extract_date_lis,"%Y%m%d"),"%d %B %Y")`.

##### 2.2.1.1 Date restrictions and exclusions applied
The number of applications and issued outcomes cover the period 2018/19 to 2023/24.

For "active" certificates data can only be reported from 2019/20 onwards. This is due to historic data retention 
schedules and the potential length of issued certificates.

For analysis based on demographics such as age and location, data relates to the latest financial year of 2023/24.

The following restrictions apply to all reporting relating to NHS Low Income Scheme:

* Limited to HC1 applications submitted to NHS Low Income Scheme.
* Excluding any HC5 (refund only) applications.
* Excluding any data relating to UKVI Asylum Seekers.

##### 2.2.1.2 Application outcome
Applications are only considered as complete if the data shows an outcome has been issued to the applicant. Applications that are currently in progress are not included. Applications abandoned before completion are only included in figures relating to applications received.

The certificate type for issued certificates will be HC2 or HC3. The term "no certificate issued" is used for all other outcomes.

Where no HC2 or HC3 certificate was issued, there is no data available relating to the date this decision was supplied to the applicant. Where these outcomes have been reported, the date used will relate to the date of application. For HC2 or HC3 certificates the date will represent the date the certificate was issued to the applicant.

##### 2.2.1.3 Age
The age reported will represent the age of the applicant at the time of application. Figures are reported in 5 year age bands, with applicants aged 65 and over grouped as 65+.

To limit risk of inaccurate reporting, a classification of "unknown" represents data with confidence issues. For NHS Low Income Scheme data this includes where the calculated age would be less than 15 or greater than 99.

##### 2.2.1.4 Certificate duration
Duration is the number of months between the start and expiry date for a certificate. To simplify reporting, age bands represent the most common scenarios.

##### 2.2.1.5 ICB base population
For ICB reporting, rates have been calculated per 10,000 base population. This base population is based on mid-year population estimates published by ONS, limited to population aged 16 and above. 

#### 2.2.2 Maternity exemption certificate
Reporting reflects data available in the NHSBSA Data Warehouse environment as of `r format(as.Date(config$extract_date_hes,"%Y%m%d"),"%d %B %Y")`.

##### 2.2.2.1 Date restrictions and exclusions applied
The number of applications and issued outcomes cover the period 2018/19 to 2023/24.

For "active" certificates data can only be reported from 2019/20 onwards. This is due to historic data retention 
schedules and the potential length of issued certificates.

For analysis based on demographics such as age and location, data relates to the latest financial year of 2023/24.

Applications that are still ongoing or were abandoned before completion are only included in figures relating to applications received.

##### 2.2.2.2 Age
The age reported will represent the age of the applicant at the time of application. Figures are reported in 5 year age bands, with applicants aged 45 and over grouped as 45+.

To limit risk of inaccurate reporting, a classification of "unknown" represents data with confidence issues. For maternity exemption data this includes where the calculated age would be less than 15 or greater than 60.

##### 2.2.2.3 Proportion of certificates issued relative to expected due date
This measure shows the relationship between the date the certificate was issued to the applicant and the expected due date. The expected due date will typically be supplied when the application is submitted and therefore may not always represent the actual date of delivery. 

Figures have been reported by number of months, with figures rounded to the nearest number of months. For example:

* expected due date of 10 January and certificate



##### 2.2.2.4 ICB base population
For ICB reporting, rates have been calculated per 10,000 base population. This base population is based on mid-year population estimates published by ONS for 2022, limited to female population aged 16 to 45.

### 2.3 Base population identification {.toc-ignore}

When reporting activity by geographic area, such as ICB, figures can be standardised to adjust for area size. The easiest method for this to calculate a rate using an appropriate population baseline. Within the help with health costs report two different population baselines have been applied.

#### 2.3.1 NHS prescribing data patient counts

Some help with health cost services are focused on providing support with NHS prescription costs. For these services the most appropriate base population may be estimated patient counts based on data captured from NHS prescribing data. Where estimated patient counts 

The patient count estimates are based on available data from the NHS prescription dataset maintained by NHSBSA. These patient counts may omit patients whose prescribing activity either cannot be identified or cannot be attributed to a geographic area or age group. For 2023/24, the required patient information could be identified for XXX% of prescription items dispensed in England.

##### 2.3.1.1 Geographic area identification

For prescribing via the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS), the patient's residential address is captured from the prescription data. This address is then assigned to a lower-layer super output area (LSOA) 2011. The LSOA can then be used to identify both the ICB and the deprivation profile (see section 2.1.3) based on mapping available in the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL).

LSOA is only captured for prescriptions via EPS. For patients receiving both paper and EPS prescribing, the LSOA data is based on their EPS activity only.

Some patients may be captured with data against multiple residential addresses. To prevent patient's being counted multiple times, in these instances patients have been assigned to a single location. This is based on data captured against the latest available prescription record in the time period.

##### 2.3.1.3 Patient age

To report a patient’s age consistently across a financial year these statistics classify a patient based on their age on the 30th of September of that given financial year. This uses date of birth information from Personal Demographic Service (PDS) for verified NHS numbers only. 

Information relating to NHS numbers that have not been verified by PDS were excluded from patient counts as these patients could not be accurately assigned to an age group. 

In rare circumstances patient data may be updated resulting in multiple dates of birth being captured for an NHS number. In these instances, the date of birth captured against the latest available prescription record in the time period was used to calculate the patient's age.

##### 2.3.1.5 Drug classification (HRT PPC population only)

The NHSBSA holds drug and prescription data at a pack level and uses this information for the correct reimbursement of dispensing contractors. The drug database maintained by NHSBSA includes flags to identify which drugs are licensed to treat menopause in the UK and covered by the HRT PPC.

For population baseline figures used for HRT PPC, prescribing activity is restricted to only count patients who received any of the medication covered by the HRT PPC. Although medication could be added or removed from the qualifying medication list, medicines were included in the patient count analysis if they were covered by the HRT PPC at any point during the reported time period.

For population baseline figures for certificates other than HRT PPC, no drug restrictions have been applied.

#### 2.3.2 ONS published population estimates

Some help with health cost services provide support with a range of costs. For these services the most appropriate base population may be estimated population counts as published by ONS.

The population estimates were sourced from [population estimates for health geographies dataset published by ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/clinicalcommissioninggroupmidyearpopulationestimates).

These population estimates are based on mid-year estimates, with 2022 being the latest available year at time of reporting. Figures published by ONS include a breakdown by age and gender. Within the help with health costs report, data was aggregated as required to include the most appropriate combination of age and gender for the service being reported.

#### 2.3.2 ONS live birth statistics

To provide context for the maternity exemption certificate some live birth statistics have been reported. These figures were sourced from data published by ONS. It is not suitable, or possible, to use these figures as an accurate representation of the number of potential claims for maternity exemption certificates. Therefore this figures should only be considered as additional context.

There are some considerations to recognise when comparing live births statistics with maternity exemption certificate data:

* Live births will not include all pregnancies which could be eligible for a maternity exemption certificate.
* The time periods can not be accurately aligned. ONS publish live birth statistics by calendar year, with 2021 being the latest available year (at time of reporting) for the breakdowns required in this publication. Additionally, maternity exemption certificates cover a period longer than a single year as they cover both the pregnancy and upto one year following birth.

The distribution of live births by age of mother was sourced from [ONS nomis tool query for live births by characteristics of mother](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=203).

The distribution of live births by IMD decile was sourced from [birth characteristics dataset published by ONS (see worksheet 12)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthcharacteristicsinenglandandwales/2021/birthcharacteristics2021workbooknew.xlsx).

## 3. Changes to this publication

## 4. Strengths and limitations

### 4.1. Strengths {.toc-ignore}

The main strength of these statistics is the completeness of the dataset and accuracy of information captured during processing activities carried out by the NHSBSA. This dataset covers all applications, and subsequent outcomes, for support with health costs via certificate schemes administered by NHSBSA.

All the data has come from the same administrative source. Using one source of data ensures that the data is complete and all data required for this publication is present.

The data used in this publication is extracted from the same source as all of our [Official Statistics statistical collections](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections). This allows comparability across other publications. Our [Official Statistics guidance table (ODT: 69KB)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2022-10/Official_Statistics_guidance_table_v004.odt) shows the comparability criteria between our publications.

### 4.2. Limitations {.toc-ignore}

These statistics are reliant on the quality of data supplied and processed during the application process. 

Certificates issued for the NHS Low Income Scheme and NHS tax credit exemption may also provide coverage to partners and dependent children. However, any demographic analysis will be limited to using the information for the lead applicant or certificate holder.

Due to the lack of a consistent, reliable unique person identifier, figures cannot be published relating to the number of individuals applying to, or receiving support from, any of the help with health cost service areas. Additionally, as an individual could apply for, and receive, multiple certificates in a single time period the figures included in these statistics may include multiple records relating to the same individual.

In addition to the lack of a consistent unique person identifier, information governance restrictions prevent the linking of data across different services and therefore it is not possible to provide any data relating to the number of individuals receiving support across all help with health cost services. It is also possible that an individual could hold multiple certificates from different services at the same point in time.

## 5. Revisions

Any revisions that we make to these statistics will be made in line with our [Revisions and Corrections policy](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/policies-and-procedures). Any significant errors that are identified within these statistics after their publication that would result in the contradiction of conclusions previously drawn from the data will be notified of prominently on our website and any other platforms that host these statistics, corrected as soon as possible, and communicated clearly to users and stakeholders.


## 6. Related statistics, comparability and useful resources

### 6.1 Code of Practice for Statistics {.toc-ignore}

These statistics have been produced in compliance of the Code of Practice for Statistics. You can find more on the code of practice and its pillars, principles and practices from the [UK Statistics Authority website](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/).

## 7. Quality of the statistics

We aim to provide users of this publication with an evidence-based assessment of its quality and the quality of the data from which it is produced. We do so to demonstrate our commitment to comply with the UK Statistics Authority’s (UKSA) Code of Practice for Statistics, particularly the pillar of Quality and its principles.

**Q1 Suitable data sources** – Statistics should be based on the most appropriate data to meet intended uses. The impact of any data limitations for use should be assessed, minimised, and explained.

**Q2 Sound methods** – Producers of statistics and data should use the best available methods and recognised standards and be open about their decisions.

**Q3 Assured quality** – Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent, and timely.

This is an assessment of the quality of these statistics against the European standard for quality reporting and its dimensions specific to statistical outputs, particularly:
  
*	Relevance
*	Accuracy and reliability
*	Timeliness and punctuality
*	Accessibility
*	Coherence and comparability

These principles guide us and are complimented by the UKSA’s regulatory standard for the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD). You can view our QAAD assessment of prescription data on [our website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections).

### 7.1. Relevance {.toc-ignore}

***This dimension covers the degree to which the product meets user need in both coverage and content***
  
The HWHC publication summarises the number of certificates issued by NHSBSA to provide support to individuals with their health costs. We believe that this can be used to inform policy decisions at a national and local level, by the public to scrutinise prescribing habits, and by academia and applied health researchers for matters relating to public health. The NHSBSA also routinely receives Freedom of Information requests and parliamentary questions about this subject matter. 

We will be gathering feedback from users of these statistics on an on-going basis to help shape them and ensure that they remain relevant and of use.


### 7.2 Accuracy and Reliability {.toc-ignore}

***This dimension covers the statistics proximity between an estimate and the unknown true value***
  
#### 7.2.1. Accuracy  {.toc-ignore}
  
These statistics are derived from data collected during processing activities carried out by the NHSBSA to issue certificates to provide help with health costs. 

The figures used are collected as an essential part of the process of supply certificates to individuals.

T.B.C

#### 7.2.2. Reliability {.toc-ignore}

T.B.C


### 7.3. Timeliness and punctuality {.toc-ignore}

***Timeliness refers to the time gap between publication and the reference period. Punctuality refers to the gap between planned and actual publication dates***
  
The publication date is determined by the availability of the data, dependent on the completion of processing activities.

A decision was made to allow a window of a couple of months following the end of the financial year to accommodate applications submitted by third parties (e.g. pharmacy PPC sales) and to allow consideration of certificates which may be back-dated to provide coverage prior to the date of application.


### 7.4. Accessibility and clarity {.toc-ignore}

***Accessibility is the ease with which users can access the data, also reflecting the format in which the data are available and the availability of supporting information. Clarity refers to the quality and sufficiency of the metadata, illustrations, and accompanying advice***
  
The statistical summary narrative for this publication is presented as an HTML webpage, with supporting documentation also released in HTML format. Summary data and additional analysis is presented in tables in Excel files.

The R code used to produce the newest release of the HWHC publication is also available from the [NHSBSA GitHub](https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics).

***Clarity***
  
A glossary of terms is included in this document.


### 7.5. Coherence and comparability {.toc-ignore}

***Coherence is the degree to which data have been derived from different sources or methods but refer to the same topic or similar. Comparability is the degree to which data can be compared over time and domain***
  
The HWHC publication is the only statistics available on the certificates issued by NHSBSA to provide support with health costs. The statistics are all derived from the same administrative data source with the same methodology applied to all data points.

Comparability with other publications produced by the NHSBSA can be determined using the [Official Statistics guidance table](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections), which is maintained with the release of each new publication. This table shows how all of NHSBSA’s publications compare across a range of measures to help users identify the best publication for their needs or understand where differences in figures may occur.

#### 7.5.1. Comparisons over time {.toc-ignore}

In order to allow for comparisons to be made over time these statistics cover the whole period for which data is available, from financial year 2019/20 onwards.

Changes to the figures over time should be interpreted in the wider context of the national landscape. Uptake of these support services administered by NHSBSA may be impacted by a number of external forces including the different support schemes available and changes to the health and financial status of individuals.


***Trade-offs between output quality components
This dimension describes the extent to which different aspects of quality are balanced against each other***

The main trade-off in this publication is the balance between timeliness and data quality. Sufficient time is allowed from the data being made available to allow for the information to be produced and quality assured.

***Assessment of user needs and perceptions
This dimension covers the processes for finding out about users and uses and their views on the statistical products***

Alongside the release of these statistics the NHSBSA will also be releasing a continuous feedback survey, allowing users to quickly tell us their thoughts on the content and utility of these statistics. This feedback, along with feedback gathered from other routes such as direct contact, will be used to shape the content and style of future HWHC publications and other statistical products from the NHSBSA.

***Performance, cost and respondent burden
This dimension describes the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the statistical output***

There is no respondent burden for HWHC data, as all data are extracted from existing NHSBSA information and transactional systems. 
This initial release has been developed with a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) in mind and RAP principles applied where possible. This development has been done in R and the code used will be made publicly available at the [NHSBSA GitHub](https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics) in due course. Further development is planned to the RAP used for this publication to automate as many tasks as possible. 

***Confidentiality, transparency and security
The procedures and policy used to ensure sound confidentiality, security and transparent practices***

Trustworthy statistics and the data behind them are an important part of well-informed decision making, and are vital to support improvement across the wider health and social care system. It is accepted, however, that where statistics provide information on small numbers of individuals, the NHS Business Services Authority have a duty under data protection law to avoid directly or indirectly revealing any personal details. In addition, NHSBSA staff members are required to adhere to relevant NHS data confidentiality guidelines.

The NHSBSA has robust confidentiality and security policies that were adhered to during the production of these statistics. More information on these policies and how we follow them can be found in our [Confidentiality and Access Statement](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2021-05/Confidentiality_and_Access_Statement_v002.pdf).

A risk assessment around potential disclosure of personal identifiable information through these statistics was carried out during their production. In line with the NHSBSA’s Statistical Disclosure Control Policy, information where a count of individuals less than five can be inferred, has been redacted.

***Quality assurance of administrative data***

In addition to the assessment, we have followed the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit, as described by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). Using the toolkit, we established the level of assurance we are seeking (or “benchmark”) for each source. The assurance levels are set as basic, enhanced, or comprehensive depending on the risk of quality concerns for that source, based on various factors.

We have made a judgement about the suitability of the administrative data for use in producing this publication, this is designed to be pragmatic and proportionate. [The QAAD assessment for prescription data can be found on the NHSBSA website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections).
